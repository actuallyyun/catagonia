# Hi I'm Yun  :blush:

I am originally from China. Before I moved to Finland, I lived in Spain for 4 and an half years.

I worked as a tech reporter in China and later a freelance writer. 

Last year I completed a full-stack web development bootcamp in Barcelona and worked as an open-source developer, along with volunteering work in tech education with [MigraCode Barcelona](https://migracode.org/) and [Code Your Future](https://codeyourfuture.io/). 

I am super excited to start this course and I am looking forward to my journey in the Finnish tech industry.
