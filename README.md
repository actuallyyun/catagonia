## Patagonia Website Clone Project 

A responsive copy of the [Patagonia](https://www.patagonia.com/home/) website created to practice HTML, CSS, and SASS.

### Key Highlights:
- Fully responsive design using Flexbox and Grid, with Grid applied for layout and overlay effects.  
- Features CSS animations with gradient, hover, and line-up effects.  
- Built with SASS, using variables, mixins, and conditions in a modular SCSS structure.  
- Follows BEM methodology for clean, maintainable CSS class naming.  
- Prioritizes accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
